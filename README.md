Learning GitHub with this sample repository.

This is what I learned so far:

GitHub is a storage of repositories. Each repository is a dev project that contains folders and files.
Branches are organized in a tree structure and the root branch is calleld "master".
When working with a project it's a common practice to create a branch off of the project and do all the changes in that branch first before "merging" these changes back to the "master" project.
